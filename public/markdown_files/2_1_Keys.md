### Fun facts / Trivia:

As there is no real ownership of accounts on Ethereum (only probabilistic ownership), you can 'access' other people's accounts if you know their private key.

As some people don't take security very seriously, here's a small list of private keys and seeds which I've found still have some funds in them:

- [Seed: test](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2a260a110bc7b03f19c40a0bd04ff2c5dcb57594)
- [PK: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7e5f4552091a69125d5dfcb7b8c2659029395bdf)
- [PK: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8735015837bd10e05d9cf5ea43a2486bf4be156f)

- [PK: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000420](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4884abe82470adf54f4e19fa39712384c05112be)

Below you will find some python code to generate an ethereum account from scratch (note that it is best to use libraries for this).

```python
import ecdsa
import binascii
from Crypto.Hash import keccak

# Generate the EC private key
sk = ecdsa.SigningKey.generate(curve=ecdsa.SECP256k1)
private_key = sk.to_string().hex()

# Derive the public key from the private key
vk = sk.get_verifying_key()
public_key = "04" + vk.to_string().hex()

# Remove the '04' prefix for hashing
public_key_bytes = bytes.fromhex(public_key[2:])

# Perform keccak-256 hash on the public key
keccak_hash = keccak.new(digest_bits=256)
keccak_hash.update(public_key_bytes)
address = keccak_hash.hexdigest()[24:]

print("Private Key:", private_key)
print("Public Key:", public_key)
print("Ethereum Address:", "0x" + address)
```


### Some Cool Addresses:

- **[0xdcc703c0E500B653Ca82273B7BFAd8045D85a470](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdcc703c0E500B653Ca82273B7BFAd8045D85a470)**
  - It is possible to accidentally hash an empty public key
    ```python
    keccak_hash.update(b"")
    ```
    This will give you this address: 0xdcc703c0E500B653Ca82273B7BFAd8045D85a470 which has 816 ETH locked-up, don't be like 0xdcc703c0E500B653Ca82273B7BFAd8045D85a470, double-check your keys :)

- **[0x3f17f1962b36e491b30a40b2405849e597ba5fb5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3f17f1962b36e491b30a40b2405849e597ba5fb5)**
  - This address is generated by setting the private key to all 0. This is a corner case of Eliptic Curve Cryptography. The funds in this account are not accessible.

- **[0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)**
  - This address is commonly known as the "zero address" or "null address". It's commonly used for token burning or smart contract creation (more on this later).

- **[0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD)**
  - This address is known as the "dead address" and is used to burn tokens, making them permanently inaccessible.

- **[0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde0b295669a9fd93d5f28d9ec85e40f4cb697bae)**
  - This is the EthDev account, owned by the Ethereum Foundation, use mainly to fund the development of the Ethereum Network.



## Transactions:

I will touch quickly on transactions here, although they are fundamental I believe they are reasonably well understood / easy to understand - meaning if you're reading this you most certainly already know a thing or two about them, that said let us look into them quickly.

A transaction is a signed message which is sent to the Ethereum network. This message is signed using the sender's private key - thus providing undeniable proof that he is the sender.

Transactions have the following data params:
- from: sender address
- to: receiver address
- signature: identifier of the sender (generated from the private key)
- nonce: auto-incrementing number indicating the n'th transaction made from this account
- value: amount to send (in Wei)
- input_data: optional field to include data (useful for interacting with Smart Contracts)
- gasLimit: max amount of gas to be consumed by the transaction (more on gas later)
- maxPriorityFeePerGas: maximum price of the consumed gas to be sent as tip to the validator
- maxFeePerGas: maximum amount (in wei) user is willing to pay for 1 gas


Transactions are irreversible.
