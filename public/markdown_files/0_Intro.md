# Introduction:

I'm looking forward to exploring the world of Web3 during the summer of 2024, with a particular focus on Ethereum.

To document my journey and share what I learn, I've decided to create a blog where I'll post insights and code examples. My goal is to explain concepts that I found challenging or difficult to find information on, in a concise and clear manner. I hope this blog becomes a valuable resource for anyone curious about entering the Web3 space.

I hope you enjoy the content, and I welcome your feedback!

Also, I suck at frontend :)
