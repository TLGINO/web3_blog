# Account types:

Ethereum has 2 different types of accounts, notably:

- Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) - controlled by anyone with access to the private key
- Contract Accounts - a Smart Contract, controlled by the contract's logic

## Externally Owned Accounts (EOA):

These are the afore mentioned accounts which you typically use when transferring crypto from one account to another. Typically you manage your EOA through a **Wallet** such as Metamask.

Wallets enable you to interface with the blockchain without the need for you to run a node locally.

Beware to choose a good wallet provider, as wallets are also vulnerable to [exploitation](https://medium.com/parity-hack-trace/parity-hack-and-153-037-stolen-eth-2a7704f59f3b)
