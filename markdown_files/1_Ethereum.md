# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum / blockchain in general is at it's core a new paradigm for thinking about compute and storage. It is a decentralised and trustless system run by a network of volunteers around the world, who together contribute to the security of the whole network. To understand some of the use cases of a system like Ethereum, we first need to analyse and question some of our society's most basic fundamentals.


## Trust
In a typical centralised system, actors need to trust each other in order to operate.

To give an example for this, when you buy an item from Amazon how can you be sure that Amazon will take your money and deliver the product? Quick answer - you can't.

You only allow yourself to purchase from Amazon because you **TRUST** Amazon.

Similarly, if a website looks a bit sketchy and asks for your credit card information you might be unwilling to give it, you **don't TRUST** them, yet what is the difference between said sketchy website and Amazon? Reputation?

Reputation is not _tangible_, and does not have any intrinsic perpetuity or value, so entities should avoid as much as possible to resort to it as a form of trust.

In fact, in the 'real world', reputation is but one of the tools used by entities to trust one another.
Entities will often resort to legal backing, whereupon entities rely on the backing of government as a way to safeguard a transaction. Problem?

Again, how can we make sure that said government isn't corrupt and is acting fairly?

Ethereum / blockchain in general hypothesises another paradigm, one where entities do not trust each other, **trustless**.


## Immutability
Another issue with centralised systems is that there is no self ownership.
Without going down the "what it means to own something" rabbit hole, systems can give you ownership of various goods (such as land, money, titles etc) yet this ownership depends on:
 - the system maintaining a set of principles
   - To take a small economic digression, there once was a time where the US dollar was pegged to the amount of gold held in reserves, called [gold_standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard), meaning printing an infinite amount of money was not possible, as there is only a finite amount of gold on earth
 - the system not collapsing / disappearing
   - Another economic example regarding the [repudiation_of_debt_during_the_Russian_Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repudiation_of_debt_at_the_Russian_Revolution), where debts and bonds were cancelled.

The blockchain by nature is immutable and open to all entities.

Of course, this does not mean that the blockchain is an ideal candidate for all compute and data related needs.
It should not be considered on par with say a Database or your typical desktop, but should be seen as an immutable ledger, capable keeping a log of changes of state.
