## Keys


Below you will find an 'Ethereum account generator', ie a sort of calculator which given a private key will give you the corresponding public key and public address.


**NEVER TRUST THESE KIND OF TOOLS FOR GENERATING REAL ACCOUNTS, USE THEM ONLY FOR TESTING PURPOSES**



You can also use the seed function which will call sha256 and generate a 256 bit hash, which can then be used as a private key.


**AGAIN, THIS IS NOT SAFE AT ALL AND IS NOT THE RECOMMENDED WAY TO GENERATE PRIVATE KEYS**
